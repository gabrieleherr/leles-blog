Hello user!

My name is Gabriele (said like gaah-bree-eh-lih; it's Italian, so you roll the r). Don't worry if you can't pronounce that, because neither can most other people I know. If you can't, Gabriel is fine. I am a 13-year-old boy who loves and uses computer science often– especially Python and HTML/CSS– and fantasizes about the cellular level of diseases and genetics. I also enjoy analyzing poetry, short stories, and novels along with History and basically any music popular before the 90's with a few exceptions. My other hobbies include playing the violin, fencing, riding my bike, and making games.
